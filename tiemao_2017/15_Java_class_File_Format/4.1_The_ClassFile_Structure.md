## 4.1. The `ClassFile` Structure

A `class` file consists of a single `ClassFile` structure:

```
ClassFile {
    u4             magic;
    u2             minor_version;
    u2             major_version;
    u2             constant_pool_count;
    cp_info        constant_pool[constant_pool_count-1];
    u2             access_flags;
    u2             this_class;
    u2             super_class;
    u2             interfaces_count;
    u2             interfaces[interfaces_count];
    u2             fields_count;
    field_info     fields[fields_count];
    u2             methods_count;
    method_info    methods[methods_count];
    u2             attributes_count;
    attribute_info attributes[attributes_count];
}

```

The items in the `ClassFile` structure are as follows:

- magic

  The `magic` item supplies the magic number identifying the `class` file format; it has the value `0xCAFEBABE`.

- minor_version, major_version

  The values of the `minor_version` and `major_version` items are the minor and major version numbers of this `class` file. Together, a major and a minor version number determine the version of the `class` file format. If a `class` file has major version number M and minor version number m, we denote the version of its `class` file format as M.m. Thus, `class`file format versions may be ordered lexicographically, for example, 1.5 < 2.0 < 2.1.A Java Virtual Machine implementation can support a `class` file format of version v if and only if v lies in some contiguous range Mi.0 ≤ v ≤ Mj.m. The release level of the Java SE platform to which a Java Virtual Machine implementation conforms is responsible for determining the range.Oracle's Java Virtual Machine implementation in JDK release 1.0.2 supports `class` file format versions 45.0 through 45.3 inclusive. JDK releases 1.1.* support `class` file format versions in the range 45.0 through 45.65535 inclusive. For k ≥ 2, JDK release 1.k supports `class` file format versions in the range 45.0 through 44+k.0 inclusive.

- constant_pool_count

  The value of the `constant_pool_count` item is equal to the number of entries in the `constant_pool` table plus one. A `constant_pool` index is considered valid if it is greater than zero and less than `constant_pool_count`, with the exception for constants of type `long` and `double` noted in [§4.4.5](#jvms-4.4.5).

- constant_pool[]

  The `constant_pool` is a table of structures ([§4.4](#jvms-4.4)) representing various string constants, class and interface names, field names, and other constants that are referred to within the `ClassFile` structure and its substructures. The format of each `constant_pool` table entry is indicated by its first "tag" byte.The `constant_pool` table is indexed from 1 to `constant_pool_count` - 1.

- access_flags

  The value of the `access_flags` item is a mask of flags used to denote access permissions to and properties of this class or interface. The interpretation of each flag, when set, is specified in [Table 4.1-A](#jvms-4.1-200-E.1).**Table 4.1-A. Class access and property modifiers**Flag NameValueInterpretation`ACC_PUBLIC`0x0001Declared `public`; may be accessed from outside its package.`ACC_FINAL`0x0010Declared `final`; no subclasses allowed.`ACC_SUPER`0x0020Treat superclass methods specially when invoked by the *invokespecial* instruction.`ACC_INTERFACE`0x0200Is an interface, not a class.`ACC_ABSTRACT`0x0400Declared `abstract`; must not be instantiated.`ACC_SYNTHETIC`0x1000Declared synthetic; not present in the source code.`ACC_ANNOTATION`0x2000Declared as an annotation type.`ACC_ENUM`0x4000Declared as an `enum` type.An interface is distinguished by the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag being set. If the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag is not set, this `class` file defines a class, not an interface.If the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag is set, the `ACC_ABSTRACT` flag must also be set, and the `ACC_FINAL`, `ACC_SUPER`, and `ACC_ENUM` flags set must not be set.If the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag is not set, any of the other flags in [Table 4.1-A](#jvms-4.1-200-E.1) may be set except `ACC_ANNOTATION`. However, such a `class` file must not have both its `ACC_FINAL` and `ACC_ABSTRACT` flags set (JLS §8.1.1.2).The `ACC_SUPER` flag indicates which of two alternative semantics is to be expressed by the *invokespecial* instruction ([§*invokespecial*](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokespecial)) if it appears in this class or interface. Compilers to the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine should set the `ACC_SUPER` flag. In Java SE 8 and above, the Java Virtual Machine considers the `ACC_SUPER` flag to be set in every `class` file, regardless of the actual value of the flag in the `class` file and the version of the `class` file.The `ACC_SUPER` flag exists for backward compatibility with code compiled by older compilers for the Java programming language. In JDK releases prior to 1.0.2, the compiler generated `access_flags` in which the flag now representing `ACC_SUPER` had no assigned meaning, and Oracle's Java Virtual Machine implementation ignored the flag if it was set.The `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flag indicates that this class or interface was generated by a compiler and does not appear in source code.An annotation type must have its `ACC_ANNOTATION` flag set. If the `ACC_ANNOTATION` flag is set, the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag must also be set.The `ACC_ENUM` flag indicates that this class or its superclass is declared as an enumerated type.All bits of the `access_flags` item not assigned in [Table 4.1-A](#jvms-4.1-200-E.1) are reserved for future use. They should be set to zero in generated `class` files and should be ignored by Java Virtual Machine implementations.

- this_class

  The value of the `this_class` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](#jvms-4.4.1)) representing the class or interface defined by this `class` file.

- super_class

  For a class, the value of the `super_class` item either must be zero or must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. If the value of the `super_class` item is nonzero, the`constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing the direct superclass of the class defined by this `class` file. Neither the direct superclass nor any of its superclasses may have the `ACC_FINAL` flag set in the `access_flags` item of its `ClassFile` structure.If the value of the `super_class` item is zero, then this `class` file must represent the class `Object`, the only class or interface without a direct superclass.For an interface, the value of the `super_class` item must always be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing the class `Object`.

- interfaces_count

  The value of the `interfaces_count` item gives the number of direct superinterfaces of this class or interface type.

- interfaces[]

  Each value in the `interfaces` array must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at each value of `interfaces[*i*]`, where 0 ≤ *i* < `interfaces_count`, must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing an interface that is a direct superinterface of this class or interface type, in the left-to-right order given in the source for the type.

- fields_count

  The value of the `fields_count` item gives the number of `field_info` structures in the `fields` table. The `field_info` structures represent all fields, both class variables and instance variables, declared by this class or interface type.

- fields[]

  Each value in the `fields` table must be a `field_info` structure ([§4.5](#jvms-4.5)) giving a complete description of a field in this class or interface. The `fields` table includes only those fields that are declared by this class or interface. It does not include items representing fields that are inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces.

- methods_count

  The value of the `methods_count` item gives the number of `method_info` structures in the `methods` table.

- methods[]

  Each value in the `methods` table must be a `method_info` structure ([§4.6](#jvms-4.6)) giving a complete description of a method in this class or interface. If neither of the `ACC_NATIVE` and `ACC_ABSTRACT` flags are set in the `access_flags` item of a `method_info` structure, the Java Virtual Machine instructions implementing the method are also supplied.The `method_info` structures represent all methods declared by this class or interface type, including instance methods, class methods, instance initialization methods ([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)), and any class or interface initialization method ([§2.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9)). The `methods` table does not include items representing methods that are inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces.

- attributes_count

  The value of the `attributes_count` item gives the number of attributes in the `attributes` table of this class.

- attributes[]

  Each value of the `attributes` table must be an `attribute_info` structure ([§4.7](#jvms-4.7)).The attributes defined by this specification as appearing in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure are listed in [Table 4.7-C](#jvms-4.7-320).The rules concerning attributes defined to appear in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure are given in [§4.7](#jvms-4.7).The rules concerning non-predefined attributes in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure are given in [§4.7.1](#jvms-4.7.1).
