## 14.3 InnoDB Multi-Versioning


### MySQL Glossary - MVCC

Acronym for “multiversion concurrency control”. This technique lets InnoDB transactions with certain isolation levels perform consistent read operations; that is, to query rows that are being updated by other transactions, and see the values from before those updates occurred. This is a powerful technique to increase concurrency, by allowing queries to proceed without waiting due to locks held by the other transactions.

This technique is not universal in the database world. Some other database products, and some other MySQL storage engines, do not support it.

See Also ACID, concurrency, consistent read, isolation level, lock, transaction.


### InnoDB Multi-Versioning

`InnoDB` is a [multi-versioned storage engine](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_mvcc): it keeps information about old versions of changed rows, to support transactional features such as concurrency and [rollback](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback). This information is stored in the tablespace in a data structure called a [rollback segment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_rollback_segment) (after an analogous data structure in Oracle). `InnoDB` uses the information in the rollback segment to perform the undo operations needed in a transaction rollback. It also uses the information to build earlier versions of a row for a [consistent read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_consistent_read).

Internally, `InnoDB` adds three fields to each row stored in the database. A 6-byte `DB_TRX_ID` field indicates the transaction identifier for the last transaction that inserted or updated the row. Also, a deletion is treated internally as an update where a special bit in the row is set to mark it as deleted. Each row also contains a 7-byte `DB_ROLL_PTR` field called the roll pointer. The roll pointer points to an undo log record written to the rollback segment. If the row was updated, the undo log record contains the information necessary to rebuild the content of the row before it was updated. A 6-byte `DB_ROW_ID` field contains a row ID that increases monotonically as new rows are inserted. If `InnoDB` generates a clustered index automatically, the index contains row ID values. Otherwise, the `DB_ROW_ID` column does not appear in any index.

Undo logs in the rollback segment are divided into insert and update undo logs. Insert undo logs are needed only in transaction rollback and can be discarded as soon as the transaction commits. Update undo logs are used also in consistent reads, but they can be discarded only after there is no transaction present for which `InnoDB` has assigned a snapshot that in a consistent read could need the information in the update undo log to build an earlier version of a database row.

Commit your transactions regularly, including those transactions that issue only consistent reads. Otherwise, `InnoDB` cannot discard data from the update undo logs, and the rollback segment may grow too big, filling up your tablespace.

The physical size of an undo log record in the rollback segment is typically smaller than the corresponding inserted or updated row. You can use this information to calculate the space needed for your rollback segment.

In the `InnoDB` multi-versioning scheme, a row is not physically removed from the database immediately when you delete it with an SQL statement. `InnoDB` only physically removes the corresponding row and its index records when it discards the update undo log record written for the deletion. This removal operation is called a [purge](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_purge), and it is quite fast, usually taking the same order of time as the SQL statement that did the deletion.

If you insert and delete rows in smallish batches at about the same rate in the table, the purge thread can start to lag behind and the table can grow bigger and bigger because of all the “dead” rows, making everything disk-bound and very slow. In such a case, throttle new row operations, and allocate more resources to the purge thread by tuning the [`innodb_max_purge_lag`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_max_purge_lag) system variable. See [Section 14.15, “InnoDB Startup Options and System Variables”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html) for more information.

### Multi-Versioning and Secondary Indexes

`InnoDB` multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) treats secondary indexes differently than clustered indexes. Records in a clustered index are updated in-place, and their hidden system columns point undo log entries from which earlier versions of records can be reconstructed. Unlike clustered index records, secondary index records do not contain hidden system columns nor are they updated in-place.

When a secondary index column is updated, old secondary index records are delete-marked, new records are inserted, and delete-marked records are eventually purged. When a secondary index record is delete-marked or the secondary index page is updated by a newer transaction, `InnoDB` looks up the database record in the clustered index. In the clustered index, the record's `DB_TRX_ID` is checked, and the correct version of the record is retrieved from the undo log if the record was modified after the reading transaction was initiated.

If a secondary index record is marked for deletion or the secondary index page is updated by a newer transaction, the [covering index](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_covering_index) technique is not used. Instead of returning values from the index structure, `InnoDB` looks up the record in the clustered index.

However, if the [index condition pushdown (ICP)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/index-condition-pushdown-optimization.html) optimization is enabled, and parts of the `WHERE` condition can be evaluated using only fields from the index, the MySQL server still pushes this part of the `WHERE` condition down to the storage engine where it is evaluated using the index. If no matching records are found, the clustered index lookup is avoided. If matching records are found, even among delete-marked records, `InnoDB` looks up the record in the clustered index.
